Per qtwebengine per risolvere errori:
For Qtwebengine, following the same workaround here (removing INHERIT += "rm_work" and rebuilding Qtwebengine after invoking MACHINE=am57xx-evm bitbake -c cleansstate qtwebengine) did not resolve the error and I got the same error message.

Solutions
The exact solution for your machine may vary, but will probably be a combination of these options.
Add RAM and/or swap. If you add enough, this will fix the problem. But depending on the situation, that might be too difficult or expensive to do.
Build the heavy recipes by themselves, i.e. bitbake qtlocation && bitbake qtwebengine
Set PARALLEL_MAKE = “-j 1” and/or BB_NUMBER_THREADS = “1” in local.conf. Combines well with #2.
Keep rerunning the build (especially with #2 and #3). If/when this works, it’s probably because of some variable load on the build system.
